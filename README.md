This is the website that showcases Alpha Wolf Vientiane Boardgame Club's collection including game details and its location.

I am using the Astro framework to handle layouts, components and pages.

Initially, I will use markdowns to handle game details pages.

After that, I will attempt to use a database and Strapi headless CMS to manage content.
