# Cluedo Suspect

This is a fast-playing stripped down version of the classic boardgame, Clue. Basically it is the question portion of the  game made with a specific set of cards used as the notepad. The detail list of cards varies from the original and the design is in line with the up to date style of nowadays.  Play your cards right and you will solve it in no time.  Ask question about the Clue characters weapons and locations on your cards to work out who did it, with what and where.  As you expect, the first detective to solve the crime wins. It s all the fun and intrigue of Clue, in minutes. Special 2 player game for top detectives!
