# TEAM3 GREEN

Three monkeys have started a construction company, and the building blueprints are coming in quick! Now the monkeys have to work together to complete their blueprints before time runs out.  The game of TEAM3 GREEN is played in teams of three players, with each player taking on the role of one of the three monkeys: the monkey who can't speak, the monkey who can't see, or the monkey in the middle.        The monkey who can't speak is the only one who can see the blueprint card with the outline of the structure that their team must build, but they are not allowed to talk. They can communicate only in gestures.         The monkey in the middle must interpret the gestures of the monkey who can't speak and relay them to the monkey who can't see so that they can build the structure.         The monkey who can't see is the only one who can touch the pieces, but they must play the game with their eyes closed. They are responsible for building the structure, based on the directions given to them by the monkey in the middle.   Each version of TEAM3 comes with a different set of blueprints and a mini expansion.
