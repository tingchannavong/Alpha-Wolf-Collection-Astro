# ...I should have known that!

Is starboard on the left or right side of a boat? How do you say  Japan  in Japanese? What is the character limit for Tweets on Twitter? How long did Sleeping Beauty actually sleep?   I should have known that! is an addictively entertaining trivia game with over 400 questions about things that you should know. In contrast to traditional trivia formats, you don t receive points for answering questions correctly. Instead, points are subtracted for every incorrect answer! One thing is for sure: it will only be a matter of time before you hear yourself say  Doh!  I should have known that!    Description from publisher
