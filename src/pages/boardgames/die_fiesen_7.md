# Die Fiesen 7

Players play a card in front of them showing one or two gangsters. They have to say the current number, i.e: The first is one, the second two up until 7 and then it goes backwards (after 7 comes 6).
If there are two gangsters the player has to name both numbers and the next player is skipped. 
If the gangster is looking into a gun you don't say anything.
If the gangster is holding a mobile you have to clear your throat instead.
If you make a mistake you have to take the pile of cards.
Goal is to get rid of the cards first.
