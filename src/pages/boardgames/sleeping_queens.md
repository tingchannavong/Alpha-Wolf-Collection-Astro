# Sleeping Queens

Rise and shine! The Pancake Queen, the Ladybug Queen, and ten of their closest friends have fallen under a sleeping spell and it's your job to wake them up.

In Sleeping Queens, players need to use strategy, quick thinking, and a little luck to rouse these napping nobles from their royal slumbers. The twelve queen cards lie face-down on the table. On a turn, you take one action from the cards in your hand: play a king to awaken and claim a sleeping queen, play a knight to steal someone else's queen (unless she has a dragon for protection), play a potion to send a queen to sleep once again (unless she has a wand for protection), use a jester to try out your luck with the top of the deck, or discard one or more number cards to draw more cards. Each queen card has a point value on it, and whenever all the required queens have been awakened or one player hits the point threshold, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.
