# Hickory Dickory

In Hickory Dickory, players control a team of mice competing in a royal scavenger hunt hosted by Lord Cuckoo! The mice will ride on a cuckoo clock's minute hand as they search for items that match their hunt card. The adorable mice will jump off the hand to collect item tiles and perform various actions that will help them gain berries, a.k.a., victory points.  Once the clock strikes midnight, the hunt is over and the mice will show off their scavenger hunt cards to Lord Cuckoo. Berries will be rewarded for rows and columns completed on their hunt card, and the mice team with the most berries wins!   description from publisher
