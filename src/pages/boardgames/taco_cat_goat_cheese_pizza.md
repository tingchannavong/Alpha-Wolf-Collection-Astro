# Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza

Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza is filled to the brim with hand-slapping mayhem! As in Snap and Dobble, each player places a card from their hand face up into a community pile while saying taco/cat/goat/cheese/pizza in player sequence. When the card matches the mantra   boom!   everyone slaps their hand on the deck, with the last one to slap picking up the cards. Whoever rids themselves of cards first wins!  For extra fun, special action cards &ndash; the gorilla, narwhal, and groundhog   force players to make certain gestures before racing to slap the deck!
