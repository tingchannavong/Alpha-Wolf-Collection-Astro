# Santa Cookie Elf Candy Snowman

Are you ready for some Holiday Mayhem?! Dolphin Hat Games is pleased to announce we've added a little Ho-Ho-Ho to your family night festivities! This is the Christmas themed edition of our wildly popular hand-slapping party game, Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza!

The premise of these games is simple - say the next word in the pattern (in this version, "Santa, cookie, elf, candy, snowman") and at the same time flip a card from your personal deck. If it matches the pattern word you said then everyone slaps the card pile. Whoever is last takes the pile and adds it to their personal deck. Similarly, special cards require everyone do a specific action and then not be the last to slap the deck afterwards. The game ends when one player successfully plays all the cards in their personal deck.

This festive game includes new cards and special actions to add to your game night merriment. It's fast, fun & friendly...the Dolphin Hat way!
