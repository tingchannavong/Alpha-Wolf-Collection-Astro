# In Front of the Elevators

In Front of the Elevators (エレベータ前で) is a card game in which you compete to get more of your family members in the front of the elevator line at the department store than other players can.  Today, the whole family has come out to do some shopping at the department store, but there's a crowd in front of the elevators. Can we make it to our favorite floors? Moms cut in after dads, Grandpas butt in in front of girls, everyone is skipping in line. When three friends find each other, they head to the caf&eacute; instead. Can your family squeeze into the crowded elevator?  Your goal is to help your family members get onto the next elevator, which can hold only a few more people. You score points for each of your family members who get on. All family members have a  Cut In Line  ability or a  Lost Child  ability. Use those abilities well to cut your way to the front of the elevator line, and squeeze into the elevator, just before the doors close. If they get on the elevator that goes to their favorite floor, you get double points. The game is played over three rounds, and scoring takes place at the end of each round. Players total their round scores to find a winner.
