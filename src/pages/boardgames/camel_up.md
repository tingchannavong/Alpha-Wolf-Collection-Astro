# Camel Up

In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid. The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win   should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!  Players roll all 5 dice to setup the start positions of the camels.  On each leg, players pick one betting card for each color camel, showing how many coins they will win/lose, depending on the camel's position after the leg.  The dice are then rolled in the pyramid dice roller, which allows one die to come out at a time and moves the matching color camel.  Players can also place oasis cards to earn extra coins.  After all 5 camels are moved, bets are resolved and a new leg start.  Play continues until a camel passes the finish line.  Once a camel crossess the finish line, all end of race bets are resolved and the player with the most coins wins.
