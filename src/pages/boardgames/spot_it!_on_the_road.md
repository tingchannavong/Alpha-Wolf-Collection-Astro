# Spot it! On the road

Spot it! On the Road uses the same game play as Spot it!, a simple pattern recognition game in which players try to find an image shown on two cards, but includes a new twist.  Each card in Spot it! On the Road features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next. Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins!  Rules for different games &ndash; each an observation game with a speed element &ndash; are included, with the first player to find a match either gaining or getting rid of a card.  What's more, the symbols in Spot it! On the Road are all items that you'd see during a typical road trip, and this edition contains a new way to play: One card is revealed, and all players scan the scenery to spot items shown on the card. Whoever spots such an item first claims the card.
