Tibo (or TiBo The Puzzle Game) is a 2-player, Tetris-inspired abstract strategy board game designed by Thai designer Montri Thongruangrat (GoalbeatGame). It is a fast-paced game (approx. 15-20 minutes) where players act as stone-age characters drafting colored rocks to build structures, focusing on spatial puzzle-solving.
