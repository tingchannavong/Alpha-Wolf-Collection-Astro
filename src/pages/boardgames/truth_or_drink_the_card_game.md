# Truth or Drink The Card Game

A simple modular drinking card game by Cut.com, spun-off from their web-series Truth or Drink. Every turn, a judge draws a question card and selects two people to either answer or drink.  The game comes with four decks of progressively raunchier cards and a 'twist' deck, which can be mixed and matched to adjust the tone and interactivity of the game.  These decks are:  On The Rocks: Chill questions for mixed company with just enough bite.  Extra Dirty: Adult-themed questions not safe for work! Happy Hour: For when you need help being nice. Last Call: Put your relationship to the ultimate test. With a Twist: Add a strategic gameplay element: redirect, rephrase, or throw a wrench into any question.  The game is played to a determined number of points.  Players win the round by giving a satisfying answer and being awarded the question card.
