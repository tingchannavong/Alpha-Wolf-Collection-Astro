# The Coding

The Coding is a deduction game where victory is acquired by intelligently outsmarting other players in a second.  You act as, a hacker. The one who attempts to cover his own secret data, at the same time, try to hack the true unrevealed data of other players as much as possible.  In the game there are 2 type of Code Card. 1. Alphabet Code = A,B,C,D,E,F (one of each) 2. Number Coed = 0-9 (one of each)  At the start of the game all players will receive 3 Codes which consist of 1 Alphabet Code card and 2 Number cards and that's your code which you have to protect it.  The goal of the game is be the last one in the game, whose code cards cannot be revealed.  On your turn you start to declare what you are not by picking 'Data Card'. (Data card is the card which tell everyone that 'This' is not mine. For example I pick Data Card 'A-B'. That means I am telling everyone that my code is not A or B for sure)  After I  pick 'Data Card', then I send 'Hack Card' to ask someone  is it correct?  (Hack Card is the card that have a question. there're several kind of them. For example  Do you have 0,4,7 or not?)  After that, others do the same thing. Play for 4 rounds and then say the answer of who you want to decode.  If you're correct that player out of the game. If you're wrong, you have to reveal one of your codes.  The last one who can protect the codes is the winner.  -description from designer
