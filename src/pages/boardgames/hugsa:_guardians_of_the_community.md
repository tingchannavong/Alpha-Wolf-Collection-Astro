# Hugsa: Guardians of the Community

In the town of Mon Khunkhao, where you live, things have started to change: the skies have turned gray, people have started to look sad.

You know that pollution is the cause, so you decide to join the Hugsa, a group of kids the same age as you, who are trying to make a difference. They go out at the end of each day to collect and recycle as much waste as they can before the people burn it at night.

But the kids at the Hugsa would like to test your commitment first: if you and your friends can collect waste and earn enough recycle hero badges, then you will be allowed to join the Hugsa and help clean up all of&nbsp;Mon&nbsp;Khunkhao.

Work together and gain 6 recycle hero badges before 6 terrain tiles are removed from the game because of pollution and you will win.
