# Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza On The Flip Side

Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza: On The Flipside  Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza is back with new characters and new rules!  As in Snap and Dobble, each player places a card from their hand face up into a community pile while saying taco/cat/goat/cheese/pizza in player sequence. When the card matches the mantra   boom!   everyone slaps their hand on the deck, with the last one to slap picking up the cards. Whoever rids themselves of cards first wins!  The entire deck is split between 2-8 players, who then place their individual stack of cards face-down in front of them. Each person takes a turn flipping a card face-up on a pile in the middle while saying the words  Taco,   Cat,   Goat,   Cheese,   Pizza    in that order. If the card in the middle matches the word being spoken, the players race to slap their hands down on top of all the cards. Whoever is last must add the entire stack to their own set of cards. The winner is the person who gets rid of all their cards first.  For extra fun, special action cards force players to make certain gestures before racing to slap the deck!
